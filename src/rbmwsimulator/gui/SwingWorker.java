 * <p>Description: A simulator to test several role functionalities such as
 * role-assignment, role-monitoring, role-repair, role-execution scheduling,
 * role state machine, and role load-balancing algorithms. Also, we want to
 * experiment with two domain-specific models such as the Role-Energy (RE) model
 * and Role/Resource Allocation Marginal Utility (RAMU) model.</p>
